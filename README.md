# KyralekosFIFA19
A mini project using the kaggle FIFA19 dataset to provide a good scouting list for football players existing in the game.

## Inspiration
Being a huge football fan ever since I can remember myself, this project was always a thing I could see me doing at some point in time.
Playing all those football video games got me hooked to the whole scouting aspect of football. Finding players who can potentially be game changers was always extremely exciting for my taste and as a kid I was pretty decent in finding players that were also great in real life (not that I did not fail enough, eg Gil Romero transformed my Palermo midfield, but irl 95% of ppl do not know him).
After having my thesis on predicting EPL scores for the 2015/16 season, this project was the natural consequence of my love for scouting.

PS: The name comes from a Greek stand up comedian who is presenting a fun snip called "Scouting Report" in a Sport Show.

## Hopes/Expectations
What I would like to see happen here is a decent framework for scouting players that may be good solutions for a particular team need. 
Hence, the end product should be something configurable with some certain parameters while providing decently accurate results. An important metric is the real life performance of the players that came in, since we are talking about players from 2019. 

An aspect that I would like to point out is that the positions will be converted to a bit more extensive approach, that splits the court into several categories, namely defense, mid/defense, mid, mid/attack and flanks. That is a more "modern" approach, which will hopefully bring better and more unexpected results in the scouting world.

Another aspiration would be to make some sort of API/Webpage to complement the initial code. That is for 3 reasons:
1) Web analytics are quite hot for ML/DS Engineers and it is a field I need to explore sooner than later
2) There may be some non-coding friends that would like to try the system out, therefore a friendly UI is a must
3) IT is easy to make with Python frameworks
